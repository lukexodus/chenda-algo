## Task Progress

**Phase 1: Setup & Data Acquisition**
- [x] Task 1.1: Download USDA FoodKeeper database from catalog.data.gov
- [x] Task 1.2: Explore database structure (tables, fields, product categories)
- [x] Task 1.3: Extract relevant fields (product name, pantry/refrigerator/freezer shelf life)
- [x] Task 1.4: Transform data into product_types reference format (id, name, default_shelf_life_days)
- [x] Task 1.5: Define user object structure (id, name, email, type, location {lat, lng}, preferences)
- [x] Task 1.6: Define product object structure (id, seller_id, product_type_id, days_already_used, listed_date, price, quantity, location)
- [x] Task 1.7: Create mock data sets (5-10 users, 20-30 products using real USDA product types)

**Phase 2: Core Calculation Functions**
- [x] Task 2.1: Implement Haversine distance calculator (lat/lng → km)
- [x] Task 2.2: Implement shelf life calculator (lookup from USDA data, subtract days_already_used, calculate % remaining, expiration date, storage conditions)
- [x] Task 2.3: Implement score normalization (proximity distance → 0-100 score, freshness % → 0-100 score)
- [x] Task 2.4: Implement combined score calculator (weighted sum: proximity_weight × proximity_score + freshness_weight × freshness_score)

**Phase 3: Filtering Logic**
- [ ] Task 3.1: Filter expired products (expiration_date < current_date)
- [ ] Task 3.2: Filter by proximity radius (distance <= max_radius, default 50km, user-adjustable)
- [ ] Task 3.3: Optional filter by minimum freshness threshold (shelf_life_% >= threshold, user-toggled)

**Phase 4: Scoring & Ranking System**
- [ ] Task 4.1: Normalize proximity score (0-100, closer = higher score)
- [ ] Task 4.2: Normalize shelf life score (0-100, fresher = higher score)
- [ ] Task 4.3: Implement weighted combination (proximity_weight × proximity_score + shelf_life_weight × shelf_life_score)
- [ ] Task 4.4: Make weights user-adjustable (default: 50/50, range: 0-100%)

**Phase 5: Sorting & Display Logic**
- [ ] Task 5.1: Implement ranking mode (sort by combined_score descending)
- [ ] Task 5.2: Implement filter+sort mode (apply filters, then sort by user choice: price, freshness, distance)
- [ ] Task 5.3: Add mode toggle functionality

**Phase 6: Main Algorithm Integration**
- [ ] Task 6.1: Create main function that accepts (buyer, products, config)
- [ ] Task 6.2: Config object structure (max_radius, proximity_weight, shelf_life_weight, min_freshness, mode, storage_condition)
- [ ] Task 6.3: Pipeline: filter → score → sort → return results

**Phase 7: Testing & Validation**
- [ ] Task 7.1: Test with real USDA product types (milk, eggs, lettuce, etc.)
- [ ] Task 7.2: Test proximity filtering (products within/outside radius)
- [ ] Task 7.3: Test shelf life calculations (fresh, mid-life, near-expiry, expired)
- [ ] Task 7.4: Test weight adjustments (100% proximity, 100% shelf life, 50/50)
- [ ] Task 7.5: Test edge cases (no products in range, all expired, same location)
- [ ] Task 7.6: Test storage conditions impact on shelf life
